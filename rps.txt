rp server is running somewhere http://server

in pf: start another 'server' on port 3000
-> node	-> go (current bin)	-> start server on port 3000 of docker container (normal)
		-> start a new rp client -> open tunnel to server -> server gives random port (e.g. 65535)

in host machine: go to http://server:65535
Server sends TCP data over tunnel to client
Client forwards TCP data to localhost:3000
Client receives response from localhost:3000 and returns it to server
Server returns it to pf user



Start 

server running 												/
server listening for clients on some port C 				/


user starts server on pf 									?
pf bin starts a client 										?
client connects to server on pf  							/
client opens tunnel to server through server's port C 		/
server chooses another port U to listen for users on 		/
server starts listening for users on port U 				/
server saves U:client relationship 							/
server returns port U to client 							/
	msg { 	
		Type: ConnectionOpen
		Data: "<port_no>"
	}
client returns http://server:U to pf bin 					/ OpenTunnel() returns this
pf bin returns http://server:U to user 						?

user connects to http://server:U 							/
server accepts connection 									/
user sends info to http://server:U (raw tcp) 				/
server forwards info to related (U:client) 					/
	msg {
		Type: Data
		Data: "<raw_tcp_string>"
	}
client forwards info to server on pf (just msg.Data)	 	/
client returns response to server 							/
	msg {
		Type: Data
		Data: "<tcp_response>"
	}
server returns response to user (just msg.Data)				/
