rp server is running somewhere http://server

in pf: start another 'server' on port 3000
-> node	-> go (current bin)	-> start server on port 3000 of docker container (normal)
		-> start a new rp client -> open tunnel to server -> server gives random port (e.g. 65535)

in host machine: go to http://server:65535
Server sends TCP data over tunnel to client
Client forwards TCP data to localhost:3000
Client receives response from localhost:3000 and returns it to server
Server returns it to pf user
